# QStack README
Centralized App for Testing Tools
 
QStack is the control center for software testers.  Companies are focused on what is in their tech stack but nobody asks what is in their Quality Stack.

That is why we built a stack of tools for QA Engineers to more easily test your browser applications.

We believe in keeping everything in one place so that is why we put together a suite of tools into one platform.

>Note: More features are being built.  Please email any suggestions or concerns to info@qstack.org 

## Features

* **Live Test Runner** - Allows the tester to take control of the test upon test case failure to either complete the test case manually or skip current test and continue with the automation suite.
* **IDE** - Your code editor so you can make changes to your test cases in real time!
* **AI** - Our AI learns from your tests and updates any selectors when changed and offers improvements based on your changes.
* **Test Case Manager** - Create and maintain manual test cases within our Test Case Manager.  Add screenshots and comments for future notes.  Allow our AI to sync with your manual test cases and attempt to create automated tests by itself!
